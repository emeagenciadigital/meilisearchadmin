## ¿Is it free?

- Short answer: 
Almost because is incredibly cheap.

- Not so long answer:

We wanted to make it free as we ❤️ open source but developing great products cost and keeping them up to date while adding new functionalities cost more.

It became obvious that we had to monetize via sponsors, intrusive ads or sell it. 

To support this product we need at least $2k to $3k USD a month.

As we don't want intrusive ads because its sucks and its hard to monetize we decided to charge only $79 USD.
