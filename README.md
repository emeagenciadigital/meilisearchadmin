## ¬øIs it free?

- Short answer: 

Almost because is incredibly cheap, it starts at $29USD for lifetime.

- Not so long answer:

We wanted to make it free as we ‚ù§Ô∏è open source but developing great products is expensive and keeping them up to date while adding new features can cost even more. If we get to 3k ‚≠êÔ∏è we will make it fee.

It became obvious that we had to monetize via sponsors or sell it. 

To support this product we need at least $2k USD a month.

So we decided to only charge you one time and give it for lifetime:

- Connect with 1 server and 1 index $29 USD.
- Connect to unlimited servers and indexes $79 USD. 
- Get the source code $2,500 USD.
